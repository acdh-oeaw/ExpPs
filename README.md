The work with a preview has been stopped in favour of the pages for the homepage. Therefore the subfolders carrying the manuscript identifier are obsolete. The HTML files which appear on the homepage are in the directory ```html/manuscripts```. Furthermore, in the directory ```html/fundament``` are the js, the css files, and some pictures for the web presentation stored.

## The Source Data

The transcriptions of the manuscripts are located in the ```xml``` directory. Each manuscript has its own subdirectory.

Two types of transcription exist: Full transcriptions and reduced or simplified transcriptions. Vat. gr. 754 (Ps 1-6) and Vat. gr. 1422 (Ps 1-2) are full transcriptions. The other psalm commentaries in these two manuscripts are transcribed in a reduced form. All other transcriptions are simplified ones.
