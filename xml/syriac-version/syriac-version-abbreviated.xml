                  <p>An abridged collection from the commentary on the psalms composed by saint Athanasius, which indicates chapter by chapter the import of each of the psalms, and illuminates the things which are mentioned obscurely therein.</p>
                  <p>We have learned that each divine and profitable book has been composed by the Spirit for the profit and goodliness of life of men. The book of psalms is especially useful and advantageous to those who sing it with knowledge and a pure conscience. 
For a man learns from the other inspired books the order of the cration of the world, the virtuous conduct and fine repute of the patriarchs, the exodus of Israel from Egypt, the laying down of the law and the construction of the tabernacle, the division of the land, the deeds of the judges, the conduct of kings, the release from captivity, the building of the temple and of the city, the prophecies about Christ, the rejection of the people, the calling of the Gentiles. 
But from this (book) he learns how to heal the pains of his wounds, calm the fury of his passions, order the agitation of the thoughts of his soul, and prepare and make ready the limbs of his body so that with beautiful ornament and harmony of spirit they may praise the Lord; 
that man may be a rational and wise instrument, pleasing God in word and deed, leading his life in modesty and beauty of disposition, and confessing and praising the Lord with the immaterial choirs above. 
And because some of the psalms are spoken as in narrative, some in admonition, and others in prophecy, and there are also those that are as in prayer, or as in confession, and some as in accusation, some exhorting to</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="71v" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>heroism, and others giving thanks, or denouncing impious, or shaming the transgressors of the law, or indicating the words of boasting the Lord, or describing the virtuous life, or are of thanksgiving, or of praise and honour; 
so then, let him use it rightly according  to the purpose he has or his need, like a spiritual healer, or rather like some great and universal treasury. 
In whatever way a man wishes to take it, be it for healing of his passions, or for the fostering of virtues, or for the struggle against the enemy, he finds that it is arranged and set by the Spirit of God in the book of psalms; which, wanting to make us assiduous and diligent for the salvation of our lives, begins with a blessing, saying:</p>
                  <p>(Margin: the first gives blessing)</p>
                  <p>(v. 1) Blessed is the man who does not walk in the opinion of the impious, and has not stood in the path of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the corrupt; these are the scribes and Pharisees and teachers of the law, whom he rightly calls impious and sinners and corrupt because they acted wickedly in their reverence towards God. They were also foolish in the conduct and corrupted the mind of the simples. He who keeps away from these and (v. 2) makes constant meditiation on the law of the Lord - clearly the gospel - will be associated with Christ the wood of life, the true God preached by the divine words fo the holy scriptures. 
(v. 3. Such a man) gives unfading fruit, which is orthodox faith and virtuous conduct; and everything that he does will prosper. (v. 4) Not so the impious; but like dust by the hurricane, so also will they be scattered by the threat of God who says: "Go from me, accursed ones, to everlasting fire." [Mt 25:41] (v. 5) And they will be expelled</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="72r" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>at once from the congregation of the just and from the inheritance which is prepared for them in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Second.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: accusatory of the impious)</p>
                  <p>Whereas in the first psalm David calls the leaders of the Jews impious and sinners and corrupt, in the second one he shows the deeds for which they were so named. 
And he says: (v. 1) Why did the Gentiles exult arrogantly, and the peoples meditate vanities? (v. 2) The kings of the earth arose - Herod and Pilate - and the leaders were gathered together. These are the ranks mentioned above. 
For how is there not presumptuous boasting and vain contemplation? For instead of (rendering) the confession and thanksgiving due to the restorer of our creation, they delivered him to the death of the cross; 
and through the malice with which they treated him, they also dishonored the Father who sent him. (v. 3) This they did in order to break their own fetters and to cast from them the Lord's yoke. For they were not ready to be caught in the net of the gospel and to take upon them the gentle yoke of Christ. 
(v. 5) But they drew upon themselves the wrath and anger of the Lord, so that he took from them the kingdom of God and gave it to the people who produce fruit. About which he also says: 
(v. 6) I shall be established as king, narrating the salvation of the Lord who fashioned his holy church; this he calls the holy hill. Although the Son, the one before the ages, is elevated among the seats of kings as befits the divine, yet the Farher admits also his birth in the flesh, and says: 
(v. 7) Today have I begotten you, indicating the time when he was made man and (v. 8) ruled over the Gentiles and ends of the earth. (v. 9) And the people which was rejected from intimacy with him, as with a rod of iron he broke by the empire of the Romans. 
Because he has no pleasure in the death of a sinner he says: (v. 10) Understand and (v. 11) serve the Lord with fear, calling them</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="72v" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>to repentance that they might live. And that you may grasp the instruction of the gospel, (v. 12) lest the Lord be angry and you perish from the just way - which is Christ - when his wrath will be kindled in haste against you.</p>
                  <p>The third psalm of David, when he was fleeing from Absalom his son.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of accusation only)</p>
                  <p>(v. 1) He reveals in it the many trials surrounding him when the hosts of the people were set against him to destroy him. (v. 5) When he lay down and slept, in his mind he fell into sin; and when he was roused to repentance, with the assistance of the Lord who is pleased with the conversion of sinners, 
(v. 4) he heard him from heaven, his holy hill, (v. 7) and smote his enemies and broke all their power. (v. 8) So now he prays that the Lord will give his blessing to all the people also, bestowing complete salvation on all men, and smiting and punishing harshly with eternal darkness the rebellious demons, who were our enemies in vain.</p>
                  <p>Fourth. To the end a psalm by David.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of prayer)</p>
                  <p>This psalm he offered after he won the war to God who gives victory. And because he says: (v. 1) For the sake of his righteousness he was heard and found relief, he hastens to make known to the friends of God that he obtained mercy through him. 
He also teaches those who opposed him, (v. 2) calling them hard-hearted and lovers of vanity and of falsehood. (v. 3) Know that the Lord made his holy one a marvel, because not in a multitude of helpers, like us, but in aid from him alone did he put his trust. 
And he advises and urges all men: (v. 4) Even if you have anger in your hearts, repent on your beds, in inactivity showing him repentance in quiet. (v. 5) And hope in the Lord, serving righteousness</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="73r" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>and offering him this like sacrifices. He will encourage furthermore those whose minds are weak concerning the depth of the Lord's guidance and say: (v. 6) Who will show us blessings? For the light of the Lord's face is Christ, who has been inscribed upon us. (v. 7) It fills (us) with delight and spiritual joy, and at the same time shows to those who are prosperous in these earthly concerns and think that they have true blessings, 
that this is what we must ask from God: (v. 8) that we sleep and rest in peace, that he make each of us separately live without sin in the hope of the rest and blessings prepared for us.</p>
                  <p>Fifth. To the end among the hymns for the heiress. A psalm by David.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of accusation and request)</p>
                  <p>The heiress is the soul which loves God, that is the church. It inherits the things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. [1 Cor 2:9] He shows furthermore through the following that it is great for the ostentation of virtue, (v. 3) that the soul anticipate the sun in the confession of God, (v. 4) and without any evil which is hateful to him (v. 7) come and worship him in his holy temple, (v. 8) and in piety and righteousness be led by him. 
For he preserves it from those who are envious of its salvation, (v. 9) those who not only do not have truth in their mouths, but also have hearts empty of blessings. Their throats are open tombs, for such are heretics and liars. (v. 10) Therefore he urges God to confute them, because they are embittering him with the multitude of their impietiers. Let them vall from their deceitful thought with all those men of blood and deceivers; 
(v. 11) let all those who hope in you rejoice, let them rejoice for ever. And may you live among them, (v. 12) because you will bless the righteous, crowning them as with the judgment of approval.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="73v" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>Sixth. To the end among the hymns for the octave. A psalm by David.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of accusation and request)</p>
                  <p>For the octave is the day of our Lord's resurrection on which we receive as recompense the fruit of our labour, when (our) enemies are turned back with shame and confusion. The prophet shows in this psalm (v. 1) that he does not refuse the reproof or admonition of the Lord, but that (offered) with wrath and anger. (v. 2) And he asks in repentance for mercy, (v. 3) entreating God to heal the powers of his soul which were weakened in sin; 
and he prays that salvation be quickly sent him, (v. 5) before he be held fast in death and hell, where there is no help or confession of God. He also shows that it was sent him when he purified his mind - the eye of the soul which was agitated by the anger of God - through sighs and tears of renunciation. Hence he says: (v. 8) Away from me all those who serve lawlessness, because the Lord heard the voice of my lamentation. (v. 9) The Lord heard my request and received my prayer. (v. 10) And now let all my enemies be greatly ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Seventh. A psalm by David, which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Chushi, son of Yemini.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of accusation and request)</p>
                  <p>Chushi is the one who went to Absalom in the guise of a traitor, and brought to naught the counsel of Achitobel, and saved David from death. When David learned of these things, he knew that his Saviour was not a man but God, and said: 
(v. 1) Lord my God, in you have I trusted, save me; not only from the enemies who are nearby, who although I did them no wrong persecute me, (v. 2) but especially from the spiritual lion which lies in wait for my soul. 
(v. 6) Rise, Lord, and be vigilant with regard to the command you made. He reveals by these words the divine epiphany of the Savour and the salvation</p>
               </div>
               <div type="page-of-manuscript" n="74r" xml:lang="en">
                  <p>which he promised through the patriarchs. (v. 7) The congregation of peoples will surround you, and for this return to the height, Lord. By these words he means the church and the cross which he endured for its sake. 
(v. 9) The reason (was) that the evil of sinners might be abolished, and the way made straight for the righteous. Because although God is long-suffering and slow to anger and (v. 11) does not inflict it every day on offenders because of hope of repentance, 
(v. 13) yet those who do not turn towards him he chastises with punishing arrows. Behold also the devil, (v. 14) who travailed in wickedness and conceived pain and gave birth to lawlessness, (v. 15) was requited with what he had prepared and was captured in the pit which he had dug. 
(v. 17) But I, says the prophet, will confess the Lord in accordance with his righteousness. And I shall sing his holy name, because through my salvation he revealed that of all men.</p>
                  <p>Eighth. To the end for the wine-presses. A psalm by David.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: of thanksgiving)</p>
                  <p>Previously for the worship associated with the law there was one wine-press, the altar in Jerusalem. But after the calling of the Gentiles there were many wine-presses, which are the churches among all peoples, which receive the fruits of those who do good deeds in them. 
Henceforth not only in Judah as previously, (v. 1) but also in all the (region) under the sun, God is praised. Because he who is worshipped in fear by companies of heavenly servants (v. 2) also let children tell his praise on earth for the overthrow of the enemy and avenger; these are the devil and the Jews. 
They are pierced internally when they see Christ being praised as befits the divine; and he is the avenger of the divine law in that after causing us to cease performing sin, he tortures those who do sin by putting before their eyes the magnitude of their sin, in order to bring them to despair. 
The former in that they said to each other: This man is not from God, he does not keep the Sabbath. [Jn 9:16] But the latter, he says, murmured</p>

                  <p>at seeing the children praising you. (v. 3) But I, says the prophet, shall regard all this great and beautiful heaven as the small work of your creation. The following (words) fit Christ who suffered for us, as Paul accepted. [cf. 1 Cor 15:39] (v. 7) Flocks and oxen he calls those who believed from among Israel; he declares those from the Gentiles to be animals of the plain. (v. 8) Birds of heaven (he calls) those who ponder hills and heights; and fishes in the path of the seas those who are not very rational. 
(v. 9) He repeats his praise in his wonder at the guidance of God.</p>

                  <p>(Margin: of confession with request)</p>
                  <p>Through this psalm he indicates the things that were done in a veiled fashion by the Lord. These are many: the birth in the flesh from the holy virgin, the splendid and wonderful miracles, his death and resurrection from the dead. 
On behalf of these the prophet sings this psalm and confesses the Lord, not only because he loosed death, (v. 6) but also because he destroyed every opposing power. These are the swords of the devil, shich like mighty cities enclos those caught in their error. (v. 4, 6) But they were overhrown by him through just judment; 
and he destroyed their memory with a mighty sound. (v. 9, 18) For the Lord does not forget the cry of the poor, and especially of those who in the spirit ask of him vengeance for wrongs brought against them by demons. (v. 13) But he raises them from the gates of death (v. 14) so that they may make known all his praises, 
and in the gates of the daughter of Sion, that is in heaven, they may rejoice at his salvation; those who pray that there may arise a Saviour for those on earth in order to repress the second tyrannical man who waxed strong against us, 
and to impose on us the spiritual law of the gospel, from which</p>

                  <p>men who are rational may learn and no more imitate senseless animals. They are also hastening to his coming, hoping for salvation. All this was the endurance of evil, so that as the impious were remaining without punishment, now their dwelling will be with men who lack a capable mind. Hence David said: (v. 25) The sinner has angered the Lord. He has angered by deriding the words of his providence; (v. 26) and this is the reason that your judgments were removed from before his face. 
So this is the chief of all evil: not to know God, and not to have requited all men with just judgment. (v. 33) Therefore he prays that the hand of God will be raised for vengeance on the wicked, and that he may punish the seed of the sinner and of the evil one; he who also encouraged him to wickedness, saying in his heart: (v. 34) He will not avenge. Those he will destroy by throwing them into eternal fire, 
(v. 38) and the longing of the poor he will hear. When this happens, (v. 39) then man will not again act arrogantly.</p>
                  <p>Tenth. To the end a psalm by David.</p>
                  <p>(Margin: inciting to heroism)</p>
                  <p>He sings this psalm after he prevailed over the power of the enemy. It exhorts to heroism befitting the saints who with confidence in the Lord blunt the arrows of sinners, the evil demons. 
(v. 2) These shoot in the moonless darkness at the upright, and through envy brought men down to death and corruption, although they had been created for incorruption by God. Therefore David says: 
(v. 4) Even if the enemy did such things that they broke down what God had set up, yet the Lord whose temple is heaven and who exercises great care over his creation, when testing the just and the sinners will provide blessings to the just, but the others he will hand over to eternal torments. 
(v. 7) For the Lord is righteous in truth and a lover of righteousness</p>

If, he says, you claim the sin of the wicked man, he will not be found; that is, he will perish because of it. (10, v. 4) His eyes will see and his eyelids will look. By eyes he means the supportive acting of God; by eyelids, his especial providence and oversight of events.)</p>
