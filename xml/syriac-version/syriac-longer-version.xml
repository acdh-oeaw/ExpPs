                  <p>to courses through divine grace, he is confident of victory. (v. 40) For you girded me with strength for battle; you made those who oppose me bow down beneath me; (v. 41) and you made my enemies show me their back; and you destroyed those that hate me. 
                     Again all the (spoils) of victory he divided and offered to him who gave it. (v. 42) They cried out and there was no one to save them; to the Lord and he did not hear them. (v. 43) And he broke them in pieces like chaff in the face of the wind; like mud of the streets he trampled them. 
                     These (remarks) refer to perceptible enemies, as in the person of Christ. (v. 44) Deliver me from the dispute of the people. Place me as head of the Gentiles. A people I did not know served me, (v. 45) and obeyed me at the hearing of the ear. Again as in the person of the Lord who turns his face from the disobedience of the people of the Jews, but calls the Gentiles to his inheritance. 
                     Foreign sons defrauded me; (v. 46) foreign sons became old and stumbled from their paths. Sons, because they were born from God; and foreign, because of (their) disobedience. For I begat sons and raised them, but they wronged me. (v. 47) 
                     The Lord lives, and blessed is God. In due time does he say: The Lord lives, because he remembered the contentiousness of the people wherewith they cried, saying: Away with him, away with him, crucify him, crucify him. [Jn 19:15] And may you be exalted, God of my salvation. Even if he humbled himself when he took the form of a servant [Cf. Phil 2:7-8], 
                     yet he is exalted. It is similar to the saying: Therefore God greatly exalted him and gave him a name which is superior to all names [Phil 2:9]. (v. 48) God who gave me vengeance from an unbelieving people, and subjected the people beneath me - clearly the Gentiles who learned the faith - (v. 49) my liberator from my angry enemies, 
                     you will raise me from those who oppose me - spiritual and perceptible. He saved me from evil men</p>

                  <p>- he speaks of the Jews - (v. 50) therefore I shall confess you among the Gentiles and praise your name. Because you have worked justice, I myself says the prophet, when you Lord call the Gentiles, shall confess you through them as they sing the hymns which I composed. Not only this, 
                     (v. 51) but I shall also magnify the salvation of his king: his, of the people from among the Gentiles; salvation, which he made for the Gentiles in the midst of the land. When I magnify the salvation of his king and bless his annoited, 
                     David and his seed for ever - that is, I shall cry to all men clearly, because this too he did when blessing his people that was anointed. For we have been anointed to a priestly kingdom. And when you blessed the people an also me David, you also prepared that there would be (blessing) for it. 
                     For the seed (of) David is also the people from among the Gentiles, in that they became sons of him who was born from the seed of David in the flesh [Cf. Rom 1:3].</p>
