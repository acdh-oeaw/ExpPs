                                    which indicates chapter by chapter the import of each of the psalms, and illuminates
                                    the things which are mentioned obscurely therein.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">We have learned that each divine and profitable book has been composed by the Spirit
                                    for the profit and goodliness of life of men. The book of psalms is especially useful
                                    and advantageous to those who sing it with knowledge and a pure conscience. 
                                    For a man learns from the other inspired books the order of the cration of the world,
                                    the virtuous conduct and fine repute of the patriarchs, the exodus of Israel from
                                    Egypt, the laying down of the law and the construction of the tabernacle, the division
                                    of the land, the deeds of the judges, the conduct of kings, the release from captivity,
                                    the building of the temple and of the city, the prophecies about Christ, the rejection
                                    of the people, the calling of the Gentiles. 
                                    But from this (book) he learns how to heal the pains of his wounds, calm the fury
                                    of his passions, order the agitation of the thoughts of his soul, and prepare and
                                    make ready the limbs of his body so that with beautiful ornament and harmony of spirit
                                    they may praise the Lord; 
                                    that man may be a rational and wise instrument, pleasing God in word and deed, leading
                                    his life in modesty and beauty of disposition, and confessing and praising the Lord
                                    with the immaterial choirs above. 
                                    And because some of the psalms are spoken as in narrative, some in admonition, and
                                    others in prophecy, and there are also those that are as in prayer, or as in confession,
                                    and some as in accusation, some exhorting to
                                    heroism, and others giving thanks, or denouncing impious, or shaming the transgressors
                                    of the law, or indicating the words of boasting the Lord, or describing the virtuous
                                    life, or are of thanksgiving, or of praise and honour; 
                                    so then, let him use it rightly according  to the purpose he has or his need, like
                                    a spiritual healer, or rather like some great and universal treasury. 
                                    In whatever way a man wishes to take it, be it for healing of his passions, or for
                                    the fostering of virtues, or for the struggle against the enemy, he finds that it
                                    is arranged and set by the Spirit of God in the book of psalms; which, wanting to
                                    make us assiduous and diligent for the salvation of our lives, begins with a blessing,
                                    saying:
                                 </p>

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">(v. 1) Blessed is the man who does not walk in the opinion of the impious, and has
                                    not stood in the path of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the corrupt; these
                                    are the scribes and Pharisees and teachers of the law, whom he rightly calls impious
                                    and sinners and corrupt because they acted wickedly in their reverence towards God.
                                    They were also foolish in the conduct and corrupted the mind of the simples. He who
                                    keeps away from these and (v. 2) makes constant meditiation on the law of the Lord
                                    - clearly the gospel - will be associated with Christ the wood of life, the true God
                                    preached by the divine words fo the holy scriptures. 
                                    (v. 3. Such a man) gives unfading fruit, which is orthodox faith and virtuous conduct;
                                    and everything that he does will prosper. (v. 4) Not so the impious; but like dust
                                    by the hurricane, so also will they be scattered by the threat of God who says: "Go
                                    from me, accursed ones, to everlasting fire." [Mt 25:41] (v. 5) And they will be expelled
                                    at once from the congregation of the just and from the inheritance which is prepared
                                    for them in heaven.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">Whereas in the first psalm David calls the leaders of the Jews impious and sinners
                                    and corrupt, in the second one he shows the deeds for which they were so named. 
                                    And he says: (v. 1) Why did the Gentiles exult arrogantly, and the peoples meditate
                                    vanities? (v. 2) The kings of the earth arose - Herod and Pilate - and the leaders
                                    were gathered together. These are the ranks mentioned above. 
                                    For how is there not presumptuous boasting and vain contemplation? For instead of
                                    (rendering) the confession and thanksgiving due to the restorer of our creation, they
                                    delivered him to the death of the cross; 
                                    and through the malice with which they treated him, they also dishonored the Father
                                    who sent him. (v. 3) This they did in order to break their own fetters and to cast
                                    from them the Lord's yoke. For they were not ready to be caught in the net of the
                                    gospel and to take upon them the gentle yoke of Christ. 
                                    (v. 5) But they drew upon themselves the wrath and anger of the Lord, so that he took
                                    from them the kingdom of God and gave it to the people who produce fruit. About which
                                    he also says: 
                                    (v. 6) I shall be established as king, narrating the salvation of the Lord who fashioned
                                    his holy church; this he calls the holy hill. Although the Son, the one before the
                                    ages, is elevated among the seats of kings as befits the divine, yet the Farher admits
                                    also his birth in the flesh, and says: 
                                    (v. 7) Today have I begotten you, indicating the time when he was made man and (v.
                                    8) ruled over the Gentiles and ends of the earth. (v. 9) And the people which was
                                    rejected from intimacy with him, as with a rod of iron he broke by the empire of the
                                    Romans. 
                                    Because he has no pleasure in the death of a sinner he says: (v. 10) Understand and
                                    (v. 11) serve the Lord with fear, calling them to repentance that they might live.
                                    And that you may grasp the instruction of the gospel, (v. 12) lest the Lord be angry
                                    and you perish from the just way - which is Christ - when his wrath will be kindled
                                    in haste against you.

                                    (v. 4) he heard him from heaven, his holy hill, (v. 7) and smote his enemies and broke
                                    all their power. (v. 8) So now he prays that the Lord will give his blessing to all
                                    the people also, bestowing complete salvation on all men, and smiting and punishing
                                    harshly with eternal darkness the rebellious demons, who were our enemies in vain.

                                    Cor 2:9] He shows furthermore through the following that it is great for the ostentation
                                    of virtue, (v. 3) that the soul anticipate the sun in the confession of God, (v. 4)

                                    For he preserves it from those who are envious of its salvation, (v. 9) those who
                                    not only do not have truth in their mouths, but also have hearts empty of blessings.
                                    Their throats are open tombs, for such are heretics and liars. (v. 10) Therefore he
                                    urges God to confute them, because they are embittering him with the multitude of
                                    their impietiers. Let them vall from their deceitful thought with all those men of

                                    The prophet shows in this psalm (v. 1) that he does not refuse the reproof or admonition
                                    of the Lord, but that (offered) with wrath and anger. (v. 2) And he asks in repentance
                                    for mercy, (v. 3) entreating God to heal the powers of his soul which were weakened
                                    in sin; 
                                    and he prays that salvation be quickly sent him, (v. 5) before he be held fast in
                                    death and hell, where there is no help or confession of God. He also shows that it
                                    was sent him when he purified his mind - the eye of the soul which was agitated by
                                    the anger of God - through sighs and tears of renunciation. Hence he says: (v. 8)
                                    Away from me all those who serve lawlessness, because the Lord heard the voice of
                                    my lamentation. (v. 9) The Lord heard my request and received my prayer. (v. 10) And

                                    the counsel of Achitobel, and saved David from death. When David learned of these
                                    things, he knew that his Saviour was not a man but God, and said: 
                                    (v. 1) Lord my God, in you have I trusted, save me; not only from the enemies who
                                    are nearby, who although I did them no wrong persecute me, (v. 2) but especially from
                                    the spiritual lion which lies in wait for my soul. 
                                    (v. 6) Rise, Lord, and be vigilant with regard to the command you made. He reveals
                                    by these words the divine epiphany of the Savour and the salvation which he promised
                                    through the patriarchs. (v. 7) The congregation of peoples will surround you, and
                                    for this return to the height, Lord. By these words he means the church and the cross
                                    which he endured for its sake. 
                                    (v. 9) The reason (was) that the evil of sinners might be abolished, and the way made
                                    straight for the righteous. Because although God is long-suffering and slow to anger
                                    and (v. 11) does not inflict it every day on offenders because of hope of repentance,
                                    
                                    (v. 13) yet those who do not turn towards him he chastises with punishing arrows.
                                    Behold also the devil, (v. 14) who travailed in wickedness and conceived pain and
                                    gave birth to lawlessness, (v. 15) was requited with what he had prepared and was
                                    captured in the pit which he had dug. 
                                    (v. 17) But I, says the prophet, will confess the Lord in accordance with his righteousness.
                                    And I shall sing his holy name, because through my salvation he revealed that of all

                                    which are the churches among all peoples, which receive the fruits of those who do
                                    good deeds in them.

                                    the sun, God is praised. Because he who is worshipped in fear by companies of heavenly
                                    servants (v. 2) also let children tell his praise on earth for the overthrow of the
                                    enemy and avenger; these are the devil and the Jews. 
                                    They are pierced internally when they see Christ being praised as befits the divine;
                                    and he is the avenger of the divine law in that after causing us to cease performing
                                    sin, he tortures those who do sin by putting before their eyes the magnitude of their
                                    sin, in order to bring them to despair. 
                                    The former in that they said to each other: This man is not from God, he does not
                                    keep the Sabbath. [Jn 9:16] But the latter, he says, murmured at seeing the children
                                    praising you. (v. 3) But I, says the prophet, shall regard all this great and beautiful
                                    heaven as the small work of your creation. The following (words) fit Christ who suffered
                                    for us, as Paul accepted. [cf. 1 Cor 15:39] (v. 7) Flocks and oxen he calls those
                                    who believed from among Israel; he declares those from the Gentiles to be animals
                                    of the plain. (v. 8) Birds of heaven (he calls) those who ponder hills and heights;
                                    and fishes in the path of the seas those who are not very rational. 
                                    (v. 9) He repeats his praise in his wonder at the guidance of God.

                                    On behalf of these the prophet sings this psalm and confesses the Lord, not only because
                                    he loosed death, (v. 6) but also because he destroyed every opposing power. These

                                    and he destroyed their memory with a mighty sound. (v. 9, 18) For the Lord does not

                                    for wrongs brought against them by demons. (v. 13) But he raises them from the gates
                                    of death (v. 14) so that they may make known all his praises, 
                                    and in the gates of the daughter of Sion, that is in heaven, they may rejoice at his
                                    salvation; those who pray that there may arise a Saviour for those on earth in order
                                    to repress the second tyrannical man who waxed strong against us, 
                                    and to impose on us the spiritual law of the gospel, from which men who are rational
                                    may learn and no more imitate senseless animals. They are also hastening to his coming,
                                    hoping for salvation. All this was the endurance of evil, so that as the impious were
                                    remaining without punishment, now their dwelling will be with men who lack a capable
                                    mind. Hence David said: (v. 25) The sinner has angered the Lord. He has angered by
                                    deriding the words of his providence; (v. 26) and this is the reason that your judgments
                                    were removed from before his face. 
                                    So this is the chief of all evil: not to know God, and not to have requited all men
                                    with just judgment. (v. 33) Therefore he prays that the hand of God will be raised
                                    for vengeance on the wicked, and that he may punish the seed of the sinner and of
                                    the evil one; he who also encouraged him to wickedness, saying in his heart: (v. 34)
                                    He will not avenge. Those he will destroy by throwing them into eternal fire, 
                                    (v. 38) and the longing of the poor he will hear. When this happens, (v. 39) then
                                    man will not again act arrogantly.

                                    is that (v. 1) they thought there is no God who sees human affairs and judges righteousness,
                                    whereby they came to server everything evil. 
                                    Then, (v. 3) that they made their throats open sepulchres for their foul desires,
                                    and their tongues to speak deceit. And under their lips (they put) the bitterness
                                    of th asp; and (they made) their mouths full of cursing and insult, and their feet
                                    to be swift to shed blood. 
                                    Not only that, but also that their feet bo be swift to sheed blod. Not only that,
                                    but also that they lead others to the fear of demons and to obscene deeds. This is
                                    what he meant by: (v. 4) They consume my people with the eating of bread. And these
                                    things he affirmed to show that the manifestation of Vhrist was urgent. 
                                    When he came to earth through his divine incarnation and found no one doing kindness,
                                    he preached to them salvation and led them to perfection. Hence David says to those
                                    who were held in shadowy prisons: 
                                    (v. 5) There they trembled with fear, where there was no feat. And again concerning
                                    those who remained in unbeliev he says; (v. 7) When the Lord brings back the captivity
                                    to his people, Jacob will ejoice and Israel will be glad.

                                    praise and bloodless sacrifice. (v. 4) Nor with names which befit their former works
                                    did he say: 
                                    I shall call them, that is idolators and polytheists and atheists; but called and
                                    holy and pious, (v. 5) and who have a share in the Lord. Because the latter was obedient
                                    to the Father unto death - which he calls a cup - for this reason he gave him as a
                                    portion and inheritance to the Gentiles. 
                                    (v. 6) And he binds it to him with cords - fetters of spiritual life. Concerning which,
                                    although he is the wisdom of the Father from whom he learns wisdom, he says: (v. 8)
                                    He is on my right hand in that we gain through his hands his heavenly Father as helper,
                                    and like a rod of power he has supported our weakness. Therefore he also says to him:
                                    
                                    (v. 9) My flesh will reside in hope. The hope then, is that his flesh will again assume
                                    the soul which was constituted. (v. 10) For his soul was not left in Sheol, nor did
                                    his body see the corruption of the grave. Therefore he says: 
                                    (v. 11) You will fill me with gladness with your face. For these things are granted
                                    us in him as the head and firstborn of the resurrection [Cf. Col 1:15], and because
                                    we have hrown rich with his povery. And again we shall be in unfading delights, which
                                    the saints will receive on the day of his manifestation from him who is the Father's
                                    right hand.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">This psalm is sung by the man who has been perfected in God. (v. 2) He asks that before
                                    the face of the Lord his justice will come forth, since he is sure he knows nothing
                                    evil against himself. And this is clear from what he said to God: 
                                    (v. 3) You tested me and found no wickedness in me. (v. 4) For it was not, he says,
                                    against you only that I purposed not to speak any blasphemy, but neither against men
                                    did I say an evil word. Such great prudence did I exercise, being anxious because
                                    of the words of your lips to keep harsh ways. Those who are of the few are those who
                                    travel therein. (v. 5) Therefore I ask that you set firm my goings in your paths,
                                    
                                    lest my steps shake. For he teaches us that even if we are virtuous, we should trust
                                    not in ourselves but in God; (v. 8) and that we should pray to him that like the pupil
                                    of the eye he protect the mind - our soul's eye - from the evil of the opposing powers,
                                    
                                    who because they have strength in these earthly things ... He also says to me: (v.
                                    11) They are anxious to cast me to the ground, urging that I think thoughts of flesh.
                                    (v. 13) But save my soul from the impious, your sword from the enemies of your hand.
                                    
                                    Because the soul of each of the righteous - clearly of those who pull the sinners
                                    from impiety to piety - is as a sharpened sword against the spirits of evil. This
                                    sword, O our Lord, which you sharpened against your enemies, save from the enemies
                                    of your hand. 
                                    And it is clear that those are they who oppose the faith in your only-begotten Son.
                                    (v. 14) When you destroy them from the earth, divide them in their lives from your
                                    chosen, those who delighted in every precious thing, to transgress the law and leave
                                    the remainder to their sons. 
                                    (v. 15) But I in righteousness will appear to your face; I shall be satisfied when
                                    your glory appears to me.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">He addressed to the Lord the words of this hymn on the day that he saved him from
                                    the hand of all his enemies: (v. 2) I shall love the Lord according to the greatest
                                    and first commandment. (v. 5) Also he saved him from the bonds of death and from the
                                    torrents and snares of the wicked men who surrounded him. 
                                    He saved again through his divine incarnation the whole human race, when he revealed
                                    the working of miracles befitting God. (v. 8) And he shook the earth and rent the
                                    mountains - the demons - and laid bare their foundations - deep thoughts - (v. 9)
                                    and extinguished the fire of their wickedness with coals lit by himself. As an indication
                                    of this he posits as a sign the smoke, (v. 10) which in his descent from heaven he
                                    made as darkness under his feet; it indicates the incomprehensibility of his dispensation.
                                    
                                    (v. 11) And in his ascension he flew on the wings of the Spirit, as on cherubim, (that
                                    is) the cloud which received him. And because in his church, which is his tabernacle,
                                    he mysteriously dwells and operates, he says: 
                                    (v. 12) He set darkness as his hiding place. Again because the remarks about him are
                                    made obscurely in the holy prophets, he writes: Dark waters in the clouds of the airs,
                                    which he showed to be clear and obvious when he openly came to earth. 
                                    (v. 13) And he brought down hail and torrents of fire on the rebellious demons and
                                    scattered them, and made firm his church through the preaching of the gospel and the
                                    foundation of faith in him - this is what he means by: (v. 16) Fountains of waters
                                    appeared and the foundations were revealed of the habitable (world). 
                                    (v. 17) But for me, says the prophet, he sent from heaven and took me and saved me
                                    from trials, and restored me to freedom from care and also from the sin by which I
                                    was oppressed. (v. 21) And now I trust that it is not according to my former lawlessness,
                                    
                                    but in accordance with the justice and purity of my hands that he will requite me
                                    later; (v. 26) because with the holy on he acts holily, (v. 27) and with the perverted
                                    he is perverse, (v. 28) and he saves the humble people that was enslaved to sin and
                                    death, and he humbles the cloud of the proud - the rebellious demons. (v. 29) 
                                    He will also light the lamp - my mind - with repentance, because it was darkened with
                                    sin; (v. 34) and he will establish my feet as a stag, and place me on the height.
                                    These remarks are understood to refer to the holy apostles, who set their feet to
                                    the preaching of the gospel, 
                                    teaching these high and heavenly things. (v. 38) And they received power from God
                                    to chase away their enemies, and trample with their feet on all their wickedness and
                                    efface them. The person of Christ is also introduced, who turns his face away from
                                    the people of the Jews and invites the Gentiles to his inheritance, because: 
                                    (v. 45) They were foreign sons (v. 46) and they grew old and stumbled from their paths.
                                    For they denied the Lord who ransomed them, and therefore he says: (v. 48) The Father
                                    exacted form him vengeance from the unbelieving people, and made subject to him the
                                    Gentiles who had learned the faith. 
                                    (v. 49) And I, he says, am the prophet whom you saved from spiritual and material
                                    enemies. When you call the people from the Gentiles and magnify its salvation, which
                                    (people) you fixed in the centre of the earth. (v. 50) I shall confess you through
                                    them and I shall hymn you, 
                                    (v. 51) urging all those who have been anointed for the priestly kingdom to recognise
                                    the salvation which in his goodness the Lord worked for his anointed, David and his
                                    spiritual seed for ever.

                                    and those with horses. Just as when he was saving the children of Israel from the
                                    physical Egyptians he cast chariots and their riders into the sea, in the same way
                                    also when he saved the whole human race, he broke at the same time the chariots of
                                    the spiritual Egyptians.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">(v.1) It says morning help, that is we have freed from the darkness of the devil through
                                    the bodily manifestation of the Word. The psalm is sung by Christ as in the person
                                    of all humanity. It narrates also that he endured from the Jews when he bore the cross
                                    for our sake. (v.2) He asks that he turn the Father's face to us, and remove from
                                    us sin and the curse, (v.7) and teach us to be humble-minded, just as he was humbled
                                    for our sake. (v.10) And that from the womb and the breasts we cast ourselves onto
                                    God; (v.12) and that when troubles are near, we may pray that he help us. Because
                                    he too at the time of his saving passion, (v.13) when many calves and heavenly bulls
                                    surrounded him - the rulers of the Jews - (v.14) and opened their mouths against him
                                    with reproaches and derision, (v.15) and his bones were scattered - his divine disciples
                                    - and his heart was melted like wax because of the distress of death which grasped
                                    him with regard to his crucifiers, (v.16) and his tongue stuck to his throat from
                                    thirst on the cross, and he brought them down to the dust of the death - that is death
                                    and burial - with the other things that he endured for our sake in the flesh; therefore
                                    he says to the Father: (v.20) Do you, Lord, not remove your help from me. And he shows
                                    that he was heard, by saying: (v.25) When I cired to you, you heard me; (v.26) to
                                    you is my praise, according to the saying: I praise and again I shall praise. And
                                    he teaches that we confess when we are saved, as He also confesses on our behalf,
                                    saying: In the great congregation I shall confess you. (v.27) For he satisfies with
                                    spiritual nourishment the poor in the spirit, the Gentiles which were called to intimacy
                                    with him, those whom he also calls heavenly because (v.30) they grew rich and were
                                    filled with great blessings. Nonetheless, he calls them: Those who came down to earth,
                                    in that they were guilty of death but lived in Christ who is life. (v.31) These (are
                                    the things) he says concerning his seed. From a new and spiritual birth he orders
                                    them to render service to the heavenly Father, (v.32) revealing his righteousness,
                                    the salvation which he effected for the race on earth.

                                    how they may become worthy of the heavenly tabernacles. He says: (v.1) The earth is
                                    the Lord's and the fulness thereof, teaching about his kingdom to vome, in which he
                                    will reign over all. And in order to make known that as maker and natural Lord he
                                    will reign over it, he said: (v.2) He (is) its foundations. At the same time he preaches
                                    about his power: All this greatness of the earth he placed on the waters, and with
                                    rivers too he adorned it; whereby a table abounding in all blessings is prepared for
                                    its inhabitants. After expounding faith, he also introduces teaching concerning deeds,
                                    by saying: (v.3) Who will go up to the hill of the Lord, and who will stand in his
                                    holy place? in order that through these two we, who believed, may be worthy of the
                                    true inheritance. And he says: (v.4) He is worthy who is pure in his actions and ideas
                                    and has not inclined towards impure desires. With these (following remarks) he shows
                                    that the angels who were serving God on earth, when he ascended indicated to the heavenly

                                    made one request from the Lord: that I might see his splendour and visit his holy
                                    temple and ever dwell therein. By it I was made worthy of salvation and (v.5) was
                                    exalted on the rock - Christ. (v.6) Therefore I went around and sacrificed in his
                                    tabernacle a sacrifice of praise. (v.11) Set on me a law, Lord, in your way and guide
                                    me in the straight path. Obviously by these (remarks) he indicates the spiritual worship
                                    through Christ. (v.12) When iniquity was false to itself, (v.13) and we believed we
                                    would see the blessings of the Lord in the land of the living; clearly in the heavenly
                                    Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the spirit of prophecy commands the believer and says: In
                                    the land of the living (v.14) expect the Lord, which is: With endurance let us complete
                                    the contest which lies before us.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">This psalm is sung in the person of those who believed in Christ, through a request
                                    calling on God for help and denouncing the Jews. (v.1) He asks that he be separated
                                    from them lest he joint them in Sheol, which he calls the pit. (v.3) He calls them
                                    sinners, according to what the Lord said to them: If you do not believe that I am,
                                    you will die in your sins. He calls them also servants of evil, because they killed
                                    the innocent and righteous, which the law forbids. (v.3) Those who speak peace with
                                    their neighbours, but there are wicked things in their hearts. For they called him
                                    good master, while preparing treachery and death against him in their hearts. (v.4)
                                    Hence he prays that they be recompensed according to the wickedness of their habits.
                                    (v.5) For they did not understand the works of the Lord and the works of his hands,
                                    as Christ also said to them: If you do not believe me, believe my works. (v.7) Me,
                                    says the people which believes in him, because in him my heart trusted and I was assisted.
                                    And my flesh sprang up - clearly in the resurrection. (v.7) Of my own will I shall
                                    confess him, and not in accordance with the service of the law which accomplishes
                                    this by fear of torments. (v.8) For the Lord is the stronghold of his people and the
                                    protector of the salvation of his anointed. (v.9) So he aids and saves the people
                                    which was anointed for inheritance and the priestly kingdom, and he tends and exalts
                                    it for ever, showing us to be raised up and glorified in future infinite ages.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">This psalm is sung as those from Israel go out end the Gentiles enter in their place.
                                    For this the inscription above it also clearly indicates. (v.1) And he calls the holy
                                    apostles sons, because he taught them to say: Our Father who is in heaven, and sons
                                    of rams those through whom they believed in Christ. (v.1) And he says that a man offers
                                    praise to God by serving the good, according to the saying: They will see your good
                                    works and will praise your Father in heaven, and honour by being diligent in doing
                                    good works, as it is written: Honour the Lord by your just deeds. (v.2) And he commands
                                    to worship the Lorf in his holy court, teaching that it is not allowed to worship
                                    outside the church which holds the orthodox faith. (v.3) He recalls also the voice
                                    which the Father made heard over the Jordan (v.5) with splendour and (v.6) which breaks
                                    the cedars - which are the opposing powers. (v.6) And again he splinters those of
                                    the Lebanon like tha calf, and indicates that just as Jerusalem was named Lebanon,
                                    so also the cedars of Lebanon are the exalted ones of the Jews, and the calf is the
                                    altar within it. (v.6) And the beloved, the son of unicorns, is the company of apostles
                                    which was the son of the patriarchs and prophets; because in God they acquired strength.
                                    (v.7) The voice of the Lord he called the blaze of fire which cuts, when he makes
                                    his saints pass through it without harm. (v.8) And he shakes again the desert of Kadesh
                                    - the church which previously was a thirsty desert, but now is holy and shining with
                                    divine grace. (v.9) He also strengthened the apostels as stags to preach to the Gentiles,
                                    so that everyone might give praise in the church, which was a forest without fruit.
                                    (v.10) In its flood dwells God; that is, in the multitude of those who believed in
                                    Christ, (v.11) who gives power to his people and plesses it in peace. For we are strengthened
                                    in Christ, wo also gave us his peace.

                                    that he may be in safety and be established as a type of virtue for the others, (v.5)
                                    for both the praise and confession of God. (v.6) In whose wrath is anger and life
                                    in his will, because his will is life, and he is led to anger because of our sin.
                                    And although mourning will continue all night, in the morning he makes for us rejoicing,
                                    when through repentance we strip off the burden of evil. Therefore he also asks of
                                    him: (v.7) Because I without your power cannot rise from (my) fall, (v.8) bring it
                                    to pass that the grace of my soul shine out again, not averting your face as previously.
                                    (v.10) Because what profit (is there) in my blood, when I go down to corruption? Will
                                    the dust confess you, or reveal your truth? (v.11) Therefore I pray that you hear
                                    my request, (v.12) turn my lamentations to joy and gird me with delight, (v.13) that
                                    I may sing praise to you, Lord my God, and for ever confess you.

                                 <p class="paragraph-of-german-text">He sings this psalm when he is still in repentance and urges that he be freed from
                                    sin; and he gives thanks as if he was heard, and narrates the things which happened
                                    to him in the time of repentance. The (title) of ecstasy (is) because when the soul
                                    sins and falls from good thoughts, (it is) like one in a stupor, because the demons
                                    hold it in sin (v.5) as in a snare or ambush and lead it to vain distractions hateful
                                    to God. Therefore he prays, saying: (v.10) Have mercy on me, Lord, because I am oppressed;
                                    my eye, my soul and my belly have been troubled in anger. For as he calls the mind
                                    "eye," so also he names the soul "belly", because in it he stores up rational and
                                    spiritual nourishment. And he indicates the long stretch of his repentance by saying:
                                    (v.11) My life comes to an end in pain, (v.12-14) and like a dead man he was despised
                                    by his acquaintances, and his enemies who lived round about condemned him. Those are
                                    the demons who fell from heaven and dwell here below with us, whon when they fulfil
                                    in us their desirce, condemn us as those unworthy of God's attention. Nevertheless,
                                    (v.15,17) in this I trust, that I shall be saved if you make your face shine upon
                                    me, hiding in your back from me. And he confesses that he has been saved by saying:
                                    (v.22) Blessed is the Lord who made marvellous his mercy in a fortified city. That
                                    is, when thousands of warriors were gathered against it and were trying to besiege
                                    his soul like a great city, through his mercy with which he surrounded me he showed
                                    me to be a marvel. Hence he instructs the others and says: (v.24) Love the Lord, all
                                    his holy ones; (v.25) be men and let your heart be strong, all you who hope in the
                                    Lord; giving an example for the admonition of those by whom he was assisted.
